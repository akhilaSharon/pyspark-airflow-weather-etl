QUICK START / RESTART GUIDE
----------------------------

Once you have cloned this repo and set it up once, you can easily stop and restart the whole environment whenever you need.

STOPPING THE STACK:
-------------------
From the docker/ folder:

    docker compose down

This stops and removes all containers but keeps your MinIO data, Postgres tables, and logs because they are stored in Docker volumes.

If you only want to pause (not remove) the containers:

    docker compose stop

You can resume paused containers later with:

    docker compose start


STARTING THE STACK AGAIN:
-------------------------
Whenever you want to work again, simply bring everything back up:

    cd docker
    docker compose up -d

This will relaunch:
- Airflow UI: http://localhost:8080 (user: airflow, pass: airflow)
- MinIO: http://localhost:9000 (user: minio, pass: minio123)
- Spark Master & Worker
- Postgres

Verify containers are running with:

    docker compose ps

You should see all containers showing "Up". Then head to the Airflow UI and trigger your DAGs or run backfills.


FULL RESET (OPTIONAL):
----------------------
If you want to completely reset everything (including MinIO data & Postgres tables):

    docker compose down -v

WARNING: This deletes all volumes and data â€” use only if you want a clean slate.
